# Connect to DAppNode's OpenVPN

## Via WIFI

### Connect to DAppNode via the built-in Wifi hotspot

If you have bought a DAppNode or you have installed DAppNode in a physical device with Wi-fi, you can directly connect to your server's admin UI by connecting your client device to the DAppNode's wifi hotspot.

When you connect your DAppNode server to your router via Ethernet you will see a network called DAppNodeWIFI, just connect to that Wifi using the default password "dappnode" and you will have direct access to your DappNode server ADMIN UI while connected to that WIFI.

Once you have access to the UI, you should modify these predefined values on the WI-FI section.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

!!! warning

Please immediately change the name of the WIFI and the password by setting up the new values in the WIFI section you can access by clicking on the Wi-Fi tab on the left menu.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

</p>

Once you have access to the wi-fi section, there are 2 tabs:

- Status: you can enable/disable the wifi.
- Credentials: you can set up the different values for wifi: SSID (name of the wifi network DAppNode will create) and define a new password.

## Via VPN

We recommend accessing the dappnode via Wi-fi the first time, so you can access the admin UI and set up on a better way the VPN you want. DAppNode supports 2 kinds of VPN: OpenVPN and Wireguard. In case you don't use wi-fi or you wish to connect directly through a VPN to your DAppNode. You will have to use OpenVPN, at least the first time to access the Admin UI. Below you have a little explanation about what explains each section:

- **Set up VPN from DAppNode terminal**: Read this section if you want to access via VPN directly, or your machine has not wifi interface.
- **Set up VPN from admin UI**: Explain how access to the VPN section and what you can do from this view. (you need to have access to the admin UI).
- **OpenVPN**: Explain how to set up OpenVPN in dappnode and how to connect your device using an OpenVPN client.
- **Wireguard**: Explain how to set up wireguard in dappnode and how to connect your device using a wireguard client.

### Set up VPN from DAppNode terminal

Automatically, after installing DAppNode you should see the next image and a link where can download the credentials.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/VirtualBox_console.png">
</p>

If it does not happen, you can generate the OpenVPN credentials manually with the command:
`dappnode_connect`

Using the link you can download the credentials or scanning the QR you can download the credentials on your mobile phone. Once you have downloaded the credentials, you can jump into the OpenVPN section where it is explained how to set up the client in the device you will use to connect via VPN to the dappnode.

### Set up VPN from admin UI

Firstly, you should go to VPN page, clicking on the VPN tab on the left menu. You sill see a view where you can select 2 tabs: OpenVPN and wireguard.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/vpn_view.png">
</p>

In case you want to set up openVPN, follow the instruction of OpenVPN.
On the other hand, if you wish to use wireguard, click on the tab Wireguard, you will need to install the wireguard package how you see in the below image.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/wireguard_view_uninstalled.png">
</p>

In case you want to set up wireguard, follow the instruction of Wireguard.

#### OpenVPN

Once you have your DAppNode running, you will get an URL in your terminal from where you can download the OVPN config file and open it in your device with your OpenVPN client.

If you have still not installed your OpenVPN client . Just download the credentials file and follow the instructions.

Opening this OVPN file will configure your VPN connection to your DAppNode from your device. The first device VPN connection will have super admin privileges so you can access and manage the DAppNode admin UI; this user cannot be deleted.

Take into account that some VPN clients might send all traffic through the VPN, which is not very ideal if you have many people connected to your DAppNode, or only to send traffic which points to an ETH domain.

DAppNode is not intended to manage all the traffic of the devices connected to it, only the ETH domains access requests.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    When you download and install a VPN credentials file, only your ETH traffic will be going out through the VPN, the regular IP traffic will still be done with your regular IP. If you want to route all your Internet traffic through your DAppNode so you are behind your VPN, you should configure it in your VPN client settings by checking the Box "Send all traffic".

These are the recommended Open VPN clients for each OS:

- Mac os: [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/)
- Ios: [Open VPN connect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981)
- Windows: [Open VPN (community installer)](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)
- Android: [Open VPN for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn)
- Linux: Already included in recent versions.

Depending on your OS these are the instructions for installing our recommended OpenVPN clients.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    Please note that for the ovpn to be correctly downloaded from the link given you will need to have the TCP port 8092 opened and that the default port to connect via OpenVPN is 1194 UDP. UPnP should have opened them for you if your router has UPnp enabled, if not you will have to open them manually

#### Wireguard

Once you have installed the Wireguard package, you will be able to see this page:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/wireguard_view_installed.png">
</p>

This step is common whatever OS/device you will use as a client. By default, one profile is created, click on the Get link button which is in the column Credentials.
Now you can see some configuration text. Keep this window for later, you will need to paste this configuration in the client app you will use as a wireguard client.

Remember if you want to access with more devices, you will need to add more configurations, typing a name and clicking on Add device button.

##### Ubuntu

To use wireguard in ubuntu, you will need to use the terminal in the installation process. Firstly, it is needed to install the prerequisites:
`sudo apt install openresolv`

Then, you can install Wireguard:
`sudo apt install wireguard`

Create the configuration file and paste the configuration you have copied before (The configuration text you have obtained on the wireguard tab on dappnode UI):
`sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`

Finally, type the following command:
`sudo wg-quick up wg0`

To check you are connected you can do 2 things:

1. `ifconfig` and check if there is an interface "new".
2. Try to access the dappnode UI, if you can access it's ok.

In case you can, type:
`sudo wg show`

The output of this command should be something like:
`~$ sudo wg show interface: wg0 public key: zFhjLJdXrLl86ayX6JpyfN0/rVH+qxgF/e8HxRP9cxk= private key: (hidden) listening port: 51820`
`peer: OQZWpDPUcNPRZMjncY6BUwsli6HtqgTUn2lAGdXVi2c= endpoint: 173.249.33.176:51820 allowed ips: 172.33.0.0/16 latest handshake: 36 seconds ago transfer: 222.36 KiB received, 81.86 KiB sent`

##### Android

In your mobile, go to the playstore, then look for `wireguard` and select this app and install it:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/wireguard_android_install.png">
</p>

Then, if you open the app you will see the next image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/wireguard_android_set_up.png">
</p>

Click on the blue circle button on the right bottom:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/wireguard_android_set_up_2.png">
</p>

You can obtain the configuration scanning the QR you obtain on the vpn/wireguard view, download the file and import it or copy the contain of the configuration.
