# Local Proxy

If you are connected on the same network of your DAppNode and you did the installation by Script. You have to be able to access to the admin UI going to the url http://dappnode.local .

# Note

When you use the local network proxy you are limited to the admin UI dashboard at `dappnode.local` and cannot access any other UI's such as Prysm, Avalanche, Mysterium, DMS, etc. You must use a VPN (preferably Wireguard) or the DAppNode's own WiFi hotspot to access those pages.

## Enable/Disable from UI

You can Enable/Disable this access method from the UI from the Wifi page, on the tab Local Network.
