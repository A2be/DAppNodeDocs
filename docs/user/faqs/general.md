## I can't access my DAppNode

If its the first time you try to access your dappnode, these are the methods you have to access:

- If you are connected to the same network that your dappnode, you should be able to access the UI through http://dappnode.local/
- Wifi, if you have installed dappnode or bought one, you should see a new wifi network called DAppNodeWifi, if so, connect to it.

  If its some specific problem, We recommend you to go to the discord or forum and talk about your specific case.

## What is the difference between buying a dappnode or installing dappnode by yourself?

The system is the same. The dappnode prebuilt machine has been enabled for people who do not want to worry about buying a hardware requirement or installing even. It's a product that tries to be the easiest to use possible.
But if you want to install dappnode on an old PC or in custom hardware you can do it, here you should install dappnode using an ISO or via script.

## Is my internet connection fast enough?

## Do I need to type in commands on a terminal?

Generally, not, you only will have to access the terminal in case your machine require specific support. But one of the objectives of the dappnode system is avoiding the user using the terminal.
