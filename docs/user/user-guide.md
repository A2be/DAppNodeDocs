Welcome to the DAppNode user guide.
If you have just installed DAppNode on your own hardware or bought a DAppNode from our [store](https://shop.dappnode.io/), the Quick Start section will help you through the first steps with your DAppNode.

If you want to validate or know how to do cool stuff go to the guides section.

The product manual will show you what does every button and part of the UI.

If you have some problem or doubt about dappnode, go to the FAQS.
