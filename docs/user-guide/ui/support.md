## Autodiagnose

In this screen you will have an overview of the functioning of your DAppNode with checks that will indicate you if there is any problem for the normal operation of your DAppNode. You can contribute to DAppNodeÂ´s improvement by opening issues directly from the ADMIN UI.

## Activity

This tab allows easy access to the DAppNode logs in order to debug errors. We work hard to make this tab irrelevant to you, but for the time being, if you are experiencing any issue, these logs will help our support team help you identify and fix any problem. You will also find a button to download a log report file.
