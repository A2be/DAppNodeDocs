DAppNode is an Operating System. Our team has taken Debian and super-powered it to be your gateway to access the decentralized web.

While you can run DAppNode on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), we **highly encourage you to run DAppNode on your own physical server**. The intention of DAppNode is to create a strong network of decentralized servers. Running DAppNode on (politically) centralized virtual servers defeats the purpose ðŸ˜‰. That being said, we realize it may be easiest to get started and test the system on a VPS.
