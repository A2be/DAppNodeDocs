# Hardware Recommendations

DAppNode must be installed in a dedicated machine. Although, the requirements you need depends in part on what you run in your DAppNode. We will recommend some minimum requirements just for the software to run, keep in mind these requirements are bare minimums and will not be enough for many functions of DAppNode.  Specifically if you plan to use your DAppNode for ETH2 Staking, you will need at least double or more of the below specs:

- 8 GB RAM
- SSD hard drive, 1 TB at least.
- Wired connection.
- Screen and keyboard (Only for the first installation)

> :information_source: Requirements vary greatly for each usecase. Blockchain sizes change quickly, specs may be out of date.
