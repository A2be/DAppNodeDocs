# Installation

This guide will follow step by step what you have to do after receiving your DAppNode Hardware in a more detailed way. So if you have experienced some trouble you can do it again following this guide.

If you have bought a DAppNode you don't have to install a thing, this hardware includes the latest version of DAppNode.

## 1. Plug DAppNode into the router

Before even turning on the machine, connect the DAppNode to a router with a wire.

## 2. Connect DAppNode to power

Connect DAppNode to power and turn it on.

## 3. Set up the de access

Now, your dappnode is starting and we have to set up access to the UI. DAppNode automatically will try to set up this access. It prioritizes the methods by user-friendly. The methods are the next:

1.  **Local Proxy**
2.  **Wifi**
3.  **VPN wireguard**
4.  **VPN openVPN**

If the method on the list does not seem to work, try the next.

### 3.1 Local Proxy

Try to access your DAppNode by going to the URL https://dappnode.local . You have to stay on the same network that DAppNode. If you can't access the web, try the next method. In other case continue with the next step.

### 3.2 Wifi

DAppNode will create a wifi network with the next credentials:

`Network Name (SSID):` `DAppNodeWifi`

`Password:` `dappnode`

When you are connected to this wifi, go to http://my.dappnode/ and you will see the admin login.

### 3.3 VPN Wireguard

### 3.4 VPN OpenVPN

## 4. First Steps

The first time you access your DAppNode you need to set up some parameters. You can follow all this process in a detailed way on the section [User guide First steps](https://docs.dappnode.io/first-steps).

After setting up your DAppNode We recommend you to read the [User Section](https://docs.dappnode.io/user-guide/overview), you can find there how this documentation is structured and how to learn more about DAppNode and its UI.
