# The NODE Economy

### NODE Basics

Token Address on Mainnet: 0xdadA02029134F73aF874640eF351A8Cf85DdADA0

Token Address on xDai: 0x13AB0Ad0b5244A4d8503147648cDFF2C68DDe2e6

NODE has a total initial supply of 100,000,000 tokens. These tokens have been distributed in accordance with the following chart:

### NODEdrop

NODE has been airdropped in a NODEdrop to our community of faithful supporters. Recipients of the NODEdrop include:

- DAppNode Team Members
- DAppNode Founders
- Purchasers of DAppNode hardware
- Code Contributors
- Active community members, ranked by our sourcecred algorithm
- Donors to DAppNode in Gitcoin Grants Rounds (with donations above $0.15)
- Eth2 stakers who have self-identified as DAppNode runners by including the word "DAppNode" in their graffiti

Check your NODEdrop [here](http://app.dappnode.io/nodedrop).

### NODEstream

90% of the entire initial supply of NODE has been allocated to the "NODEstream" which is set to flow for a period of 3 years (36 months - i.e. until July 2024). This is essentially a continous stream of NODE that flows out of the "Reservoir" and into the "Claimable" section of the dashboard. NODEstream distribution can be roughly tracked as follows:

| Month | Claimable | Held in Reservoir |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | 10%       | 90%               |
| 9     | 32.5%     | 67.5%             |
| 18    | 55%       | 45%               |
| 27    | 77.5%     | 22.5%             |
| 36    | 100%      | 0%                |

The NODEstream works on a time-based linear function, meaning the reservoir will gradually hold a smaller percentage of your NODE and thus more NODE is made instantly available from your staking rewards. At the end of the NODEstream The reservoir will no longer hold any NODE and 100% of your staking rewards will be instantly claimable.

The NODEstream has been designed to encourage long-term participation in the NODE Economy. As the NODE Economy grows and the DAppNode universe expands, our community is awarded even more NODE to use in DAO governance.

Recipients of the NODEdrop on xDai Network are granted the NODEstream, whereas on Mainnet the NODEdrop does not include the NODEstream automatically. In order to receive and augment the flow of NODE you must provide liquidity in any of the eligible pools. Some part of the rewards earned from NODEstaking are claimable immediately, where as the other part is allocated to the reservoir for NODEstreaming.
