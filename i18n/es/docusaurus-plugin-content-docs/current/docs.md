# Help to translate

As you can see we have added 2 more languages to the documentation, if you want to help us with the translation process, now you can do it using the platform crowdin for it.

## How can I collaborate with the translation of DAppNode Documentation?

Requisites:

- A crowdin account

### 1. Crowdin platform

Access https://crowdin.com/project/dappnodedocs.

You will see the following page, where you can select what languages you wish to translate into:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../../img/translation_1.png"/>
</p>

Once you have selected the language, you will see a tree folder with all the files of the documentation. You can see too two statistics:

- Words translated: words that have been translated by someone. They are shown in colour blue.
- Words approved: words that have been translated and someone has confirmed the translation is correct. Shown in green colour.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../../img/translation_2.png"/>
</p>

Navigate to the file you wish to translate and click on the filename.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../../img/translation_3.png"/>
</p>

In this example, we can see 2 different highlighted sections:

- Red highlight: Text that has not been translated yet.
- Green highlight: Text that has already been translated.

On this page, you can do 2 things: translate the file and/or vote/approve a translation.

#### 2.1 Add translation

The file is divided in strings or phrases. You need to click on it the phrase you want to translate. If I want to translate the sentence `This documentation has 4 types of content depending on what you want to do:`, I click on it and I see the next image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../../img/translation_4.png"/>
</p>

Translate the sentence on the right panel, under `Enter translation here`, and click on the SAVE button.

##### 2.1.1 Maintain the style of the text

If the original text has style tags like in the example: `<strong x-id="1">Get Started</strong> : you can find what you need to run a DAppNode, hardware recommendations or how to get DAppNode hardware.`, you will need to maintain it.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../../img/translation_5.png"/>
</p>

To do so, copy the tags `<strong x-id="1">Get Started</strong>` and change the content inside of them. In this example, the result would be something like:

`<strong x-id="1">Iniciaci√≥n</strong> : you can find what you need to run a DAppNode, hardware recommendations or how to get DAppNode hardware.`

### 2.2 Approve translation or make a different suggestion.

In case there's an already existing translation, you will be able to suggest an alternative translation or to validate it. For this, select the green/blue marked texts and vote up/down for the translation, or suggest an alternative translation.
